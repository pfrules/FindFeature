% Function: readHISfile
%
% Inputs:   fileLocation    File name and path of VFF file
%
% Outputs:  im              Image contained in HIS file
%
% Purpose:  To open/read a HIS file from the PerkinElmer HIS data type
%
% Notes:
% - Header is 100 bytes (50 uint16's)
% - # of Columns/Rows is at uint16 number 9 & 10 (by inspection), not sure
%   which is which at this point, but doesn't really matter
%
% Changelog:
% March 17, 2010 - Initial creation
% March 19, 2010 - Properly fail is file does not exist
